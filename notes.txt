wrong words (words with >0 !isCorrect) have a red underline
wrong characters show the intended character if there is one at that position, else the character
i.e. display[i] = i < word.len ? word[i] : input[i]
wrong characters if part of the word show a bold red, otherwise a faded dark red
i.e.
```ts
color = i < word.len
 ? isCorrect(word, i)
   ? white
   : red
 : dark_red

if the line in focus is the first row, the focus will be on the first row
otherwise, the focus is on the middle row
there is a total of 3 rows at any one time
idea: split rows based on characters. max n characters on any row. otherwise, it gets delegated to the next row
